This paper introduces the notion of 'Deconvnet' which enables us to vizualise
each layer. By vizualising each layer, we can get more insight about what the model
is learning and thus, make some adjustements to make it more optimize. That's
how ZFnet was created, an AlexNet fine-tuned version based on Visualization Results.
ZFnet has one change:

- Conv1: change from (11x11 stride 4) to (7x7 stride 2).

Results:
- By using AlexNet, top-5 validation error rate is 18.2%.
- By using ZFNet, top-5 validation error rate is 16.5%.

They decided to also add changes in other convolutional layers:

- Conv3: uses 512 filters instead of 384.
- Conv4: uses 1024 filters instead of 384.
- Conv5: uses 512 filters instead of 256.

Results:
- By using ZFnet, top-5 validation error rate is 16.0%.


Conclusion:

By visualizing the convolutional network layer by layer, ZFNet adjusts the layersâ€™
hyperparameters such as filter size or stride of the AlexNet and successfully 
reduces the error rates.
